# Community UX Brainstorming

*By Maureen Hanratty and Valentin Tsatskin at Mozilla SF, on May 16th, 2014*

This document consists of things we think would be useful for community members
for contributing to Firefox OS, Firefox Desktop, Firefox for Android and
Marketplace. It was originally a
[whiteboard drawing](brainstorming.original.jpg).

Unfortunately there's a lot more questions than answers on here. We should
figure out how to answer these questions.

## Who are contributors

* Students
* Developers who want to learn UX
* UX Professionals
* People in our FxOS launch markets

## Content needed for Community on Wiki

### What is the design process?
* How do I make a spec?
* How do I validate a design?
* How do I share a design with Mozilla people?

### Learn > Build > Evaluate loop

As part of our design process recommended to UX Community members, we want them
to follow a learn, build, evaluate loop.

#### Learn

* Where are Mozilla research findings?
* After cycling through the loop, how can community members share what they've
learned from evaluating their designs?

#### Build

* How does a community member go about making a prototype to test?
* How can community and/or mozilla developers team up with communtiy UXers to
help create prototypes?
* Different methods community members can use to prototype their ideas
  * Sketching
  * Prototyping
  * Mocks

#### Evaluate

* How should Community members evaluate their designs?
* Various methods
  * Usability study
  * Qualitative studies
  * Quantitative analysis
    * How do they coordinate with our metrics teams to get the insights they
    want?

### Resources

* Projects in progress
  * They want to know how to get involved in current and future projects
  * Can we make a resource where people can see all the experimental stuff
  we are working on?
* Assets and Styleguides to work with
* Community channels
  * Who can they talk to?
  * Mailing lists
  * IRC Channels
  * Team specific locations?
* Research findings

### Sharing work

* Where do deliverables such as specs, mocks, findings go?
  * Github?
  * Personal website?
  * Bugzilla?
* How do people get feedback from Mozillians? (ordered in priority)
  * Design
  * Developers
  * Product
  * Strategy
